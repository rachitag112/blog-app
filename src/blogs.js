      "I started my programming journey when I was in secondary school. Back then, I joined an Infocomm club and I started to learn Scratch, a versatile drag-and-drop tool that teaches me simple logic flow, data conditioning and simple iteration loops. It got me so interested in programming that I spent hours making a flight simulator on Scratch.\n\nI was so into programming that I took the computing class for my GCE O Levels. There, I started learning my first real programming language and that was Python. I was learning data structuring, the basics of networking, functions and classes and much more. My computing teacher gave my classes a series of programming questions in a gamified manner. Each time we got an algorithm correct, we were awarded points. My friends and I will spend time after school trying to outdo each other.\n\nWith the experience I had, and the opportunities I was given, I decided to pursue a career in programming. I am currently studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore. I am currently in my 3rd year and I am looking forward to my final year project and internship opportunities.",

      "StackUp.dev is a platform that allows individuals to track and showcase their coding skills and progress. I recently joined the platform and have had a positive experience so far. One of the things I appreciate most about StackUp.dev is the ability to connect with other developers and see what they are working on. This has given me inspiration for new projects and allowed me to learn from others in the community. I also appreciate the ability to track my progress and see my progress over time. This has helped me stay motivated and focused on my goals. The platform also offers a variety of coding challenges and quizzes that help me to test my knowledge and improve my skills.\n \nOverall, StackUp.dev has been a valuable tool in my coding journey and I look forward to continuing to use it as I continue to learn and improve.",
